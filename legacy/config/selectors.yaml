selectors:
  chat_list:
    aria_label: "Chat list"
    # role: "button" - removed to be more robust, as it might be a div or list
  message_input:
    role: "textbox"
    aria_label: "Type a message"
  send_button:
    aria_label: "Send"
  unread_badge:
    aria_label: "Unread"
  chat_row:
    css: "div[role='row']" # broader than split role/aria
  message_bubble:
    css: "div[role='row']"  # Messages are often rows too in recent updates, or we fallback to class in code if needed.
    # Actually, let's use a class-based one for now as it's more distinct if role is same
    # But wait, keeping "robust" requirement.
    # Recent WA Web uses role="row" for messages too inside the main region?
    # Let's try to target the message container first.
  message_text:
    css: "span.selectable-text"
  message_info:
    css: "div[data-pre-plain-text]"
  chat_title:
    css: "header span[title]"
  chat_subtitle:
    css: "header div[role='button'] span[title]" # Often contains 'click here for group info' or member names for groups
  chat_list_title:
    css: "span[title]" # Relative to chat_row
  
  # Contact Info Drawer Selectors
  header_title_container:
    css: "#main header span[title]" # Click the text directly, it works and is unique.
  contact_drawer:
    css: "#app > div > div > div:nth-child(2) > div.landing-wrapper-body > div > div > div" # The drawer sliding in from right. This is tricky, often better to wait for a specific reliable child.
    # Alternatives: "div[title='Contact info']" or similar if present.
    # Better: Wait for the specific "Close" button or the main "Contact info" header.
  contact_drawer_close_btn:
    css: "div[aria-label='Close']"
  contact_info_name:
    css: "section span[dir='auto']" # Usually the big name text
  contact_info_phone:
    css: "span[aria-label='Phone number']" # Often has aria-label? No, it's usually just text. We might need a heuristic (starts with +)
    # Actually, often in a section with 'About and phone number'
  contact_info_about:
    css: "span[title]" # The 'About' status often has a title attribute overlapping with the text
